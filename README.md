<h1 align='center'>‚ö†Ô∏è POPUP HAVOC ‚ö†Ô∏è</h1><br>

**POPUP HAVOC** is a small PICO-8 game, in which the player tries to earn the most points by closing popups or clicking on them to receive buffs or virusus. This game was made after I had the idea of downloading virusus that would change how the screen looked liked in PICO-8 and was partialy inspired by Zayuh's ['Popup Mayhem'](https://zayuhgames.itch.io/virus-mayhem)<br>

## üéÆ HOW TO PLAY 

üê≠ - Interact with popups and files

Earn points by closing popups using your mouse. You can also download virusus from harmful popups to earn more points per popup ,but if you get to **greedy** then you might find yourself unable to close the popups fast enough to keep them from crashing your game. There are also popups that will explode taking a chunk of your points and popups with temporary multipliers so be on the lookout for them.<br>
