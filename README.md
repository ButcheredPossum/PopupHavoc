# 📎 POPUP HAVOC
**POPUP HAVOC** is a small PICO-8 game, in which the player tries to earn the most points by closing popups or clicking on them to receive buffs or virusus. This game was made after I had the idea of downloading virusus that would change how the screen looked liked in PICO-8 and was partialy inspired by Zayuh's ['Popup Mayhem'](https://zayuhgames.itch.io/virus-mayhem)
